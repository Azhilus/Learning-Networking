# IPv4 Overview

### 1. Definition:
   - IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, used to identify devices on a network and facilitate data communication.

### 2. Parts of IPv4:
   - Network Part: Identifies the network the device belongs to.
   - Host Part: Identifies the specific device on the network.
   - Subnet Number: Optionally used to divide large networks into smaller subnetworks.

### 3. Characteristics:
   - 32-Bit IP Address represented in decimal notation.
   - Supports Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast addresses.
   - Uses Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM).
   - Utilizes Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to map IP to MAC addresses.
   - Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for routing.
   - Supports packet fragmentation for efficient data transfer.

### 4. Advantages:
   - Encryption for security.
   - Wide adoption with over 85000 practical routers.
   - Easy connectivity across large networks.
   - Efficient data transfer and quality service.
   - Scalable routing and specific communication in multicast setups.

### 5. Limitations:
   - Limited address space leading to address exhaustion.
   - Inefficient internet routing.
   - High system management costs.
   - Security features optional and may be complex to implement.
   - Difficulty in accommodating future needs.
   - Reliance on unique IP addresses for network endpoints.
   - Depletion of available unique IP addresses.
   - Complexity in host and routing configurations.
   - Challenges in providing security, Quality of Service (QoS), and multicasting.

IPv4's limitations have led to the development and adoption of IPv6 to address these shortcomings.
